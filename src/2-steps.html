                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>At ReaderMonthly we believe that our customers should always be able to get books that provide them
                    with a pleasant and enjoyable read. Maybe you like different genres? No problem! Mix and Match as
                    you would like. One or four books at once? Always free delivery! We’re sure you will love our
                    service!</p>

                <h2>It’s all up to you</h2>
                <p>We believe in empowering you, our customer. In doing so we believe that you can have the best
                    possible time reading the books you love, and discovering new books as well. Maybe even new genres!
                    To cater to everyone, we have decided on having no less than three different membership
                    opportunities. You earn credits, and can use them for new books in our <a href="signup-page.html">shop</a>.

                    (that you find under For members). Here you will find a wide selection of books – with our most
                    popular being:</p>
                <h2>What are Credits, and how do I use them?</h2>
                <p>Every month we convert your billable membership plan into Credits.
                    We have set the Euro (€) to Credit conversion rate at 1 to 10, which means 1 Euro (€) equals 10
                    credits.</p>
                <p>By always converting your monthly membership into Credits, you are able to save up or postpone any
                    shipments from your account. Instead of us sending you a fixed box of products at a certain price
                    every month, you now have the possibility and flexibility of being able to tailor your shipment as
                    you wish.</p>
                <p>After you sign up, all you have to do is to go the shop, login with your details, and create and
                    order with your desired products. We always ship directly to your doorstep, absolutely free of
                    charge. There’s no hidden or extra fee’s, everything is covered by your monthly membership plan.
                </p>
                <p>Credits are automatically transferred to your membership each month. Depending on which membership
                    you have, you will receive either 90, 290 or 490 credits each month.</p>
